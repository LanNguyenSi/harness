  # call writes into. It fires at the FIRST source mutation, catching the
  # \"forgot to branch off master\" pattern before any edit lands.
  #
  # The hook asks git (\`git -C <dir> symbolic-ref -q HEAD\`) on every call;
  # the way forward for the agent is a feature branch
  # (\`git checkout -b <feature>\`). Fails closed: a manifest that does not
  # load or a git that cannot answer refuses the call. Outside a repository
  # and on a detached HEAD the call is allowed.
  #
  # Disable by setting \`enabled: false\` or removing this entry if your
  # workflow routinely edits master directly. Override the protected list
  # via \`config.protected_branches\`. Full reference:
