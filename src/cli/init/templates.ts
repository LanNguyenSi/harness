# scripts under ~/.claude/hooks/ are required.
#
# Canonical source for the policy + policy_packs sections is
# docs/examples/full-manifest.yaml. A parity vitest
# (tests/cli/init-full-template-parity.test.ts) fails the build if the
# two diverge on policy names or load-bearing fields.

# What you still need on PATH (the wizard offers to \`npm i -g\` these on

# All PreToolUse hooks share the generic \`harness policy intercept\` CLI
# entrypoint. The engine reads the tool event on stdin, evaluates whichever
# policy below has a matching trigger (\`match\` + optional \`bash_match\`),
# and emits Claude Code's deny envelope when the required ledger tag is
# absent. No external shell scripts are required.
#
# The \`git-preflight\` SessionStart hook is the producer side of the
# \`preflight-before-*\` policies: \`harness session-start preflight\` runs
# agent-preflight against the session cwd and, on a ready:true result,
# records \`preflight:\${REPO}\` to the evidence ledger. It needs the
# \`preflight\` binary on PATH (\`npm i -g @lannguyensi/agent-preflight\`); when
# that is absent the hook logs to stderr and exits 0, so the session is
# never broken — the preflight gates just stay closed until a tag is
# produced some other way.
