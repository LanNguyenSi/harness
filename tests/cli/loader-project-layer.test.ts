// Loader-level primitive underneath the per-repo project override layer
// story (task 30183330, review round 3; task `c88461c1` builds per-repo
// scoping on top of this contract).
//
// `resolvePaths` resolves a project override layer ONLY when
// `LoaderOptions.project` is explicitly set; it never inspects cwd or
// any other ambient signal on its own. This file pins that low-level
// contract in isolation: without `project`, a project override layer
// that sits on disk is neither resolved nor merged, so its override
// cannot influence what a caller reads. The same layer IS honoured when
// `project` is passed explicitly.
//
// The probe value here is `grounding.evidence_ledger.path`, chosen only
// because it is a scalar a project layer can override and whose base
// and project values are easy to tell apart. The contract under test
// belongs to the loader, not to the key: any deep-merged manifest field
// would exercise it identically.
