## Acceptance-Baseline Coverage

The Acceptance-Baseline Coverage and Open Required Residuals sections apply
only to a run that recorded `Acceptance contract: acceptance-baseline/v1` in
`00-goal.md` at creation before slicing. Existing runs retain their recorded
original summary contract. Unknown provenance is resolved before dependent
delegation; missing fields never select a version or require migration.

This table indexes the implementer's returned `criterion_evidence` references
against the frozen `acceptance_baseline` and assigned criteria. Empty
`evidence_refs: []` stays unresolved, with its reason in risks/open questions.
This table indexes result artifacts; it is not a results database and does not
itself accept work. A required criterion with missing, aborted, skipped,
unresolved, wrong-state, or wrong-baseline evidence remains an open residual
and blocks acceptance.

| Criterion ID | Baseline ID / revision | Evidence reference | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| <!-- AC-001 --> | <!-- acceptance-baseline / r1 --> | <!-- relative result artifact reference --> | <!-- pass/fail/manual/residual --> |

An automated result artifact identifies its attempt, repository, checked
revision including relevant dirty-state identity, cwd, applied check definition,
status, exit or abort information, and baseline/criterion identities. A manual reference
identifies the artifact revision, reviewer, method, pass/fail standard, and
reasoned result and baseline/criterion identities; it remains explicitly manual. Coverage never turns a reviewer
recommendation or accepted risk into automated verification.

Each reference resolves relative to the directory containing this summary
file, with a precise artifact or fragment locator when needed. It must identify the
same baseline and criterion as the frozen delegated record; a copied label or
an optional row cannot stand in for a required criterion.

## Open Required Residuals

| Criterion ID | Why evidence is not decisive | Acceptance effect |
|---|---|---|
| <!-- AC-001 --> | <!-- missing/aborted/skipped/unresolved/wrong state or baseline --> | blocks acceptance |

## Test Evidence

### Verification Set

Record the frozen set reference (path plus digest), repository identity,
effective configuration/scripts, preflight executable identity/definition, and
every ordered `(kind, name, occurrence)` result with cwd and artifact. A
missing-tool preflight limitation may have no raw child result, but is never a
pass; disabled required categories are gaps. Missing, extra, mismatched, or
unresolved results are misfires. Failures, skips, acknowledgements,
limitations, and inconclusive outcomes remain explicit non-passes.

| Set reference / digest | Repository identity                    | Result identity                   | Cwd          | Result artifact / status            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| <!-- path / digest --> | <!-- repo / revision / dirty state --> | <!-- kind / name / occurrence --> | <!-- cwd --> | <!-- artifact / non-pass reason --> |

### Mutation Probes

Before/After cells hold a single-line excerpt. When the mutant's actual
before/after text is multi-line or contains an unescaped `|`, or the mutant
is a patch/diff rather than a text swap, put the full text or diff in the
implementer report or a fenced block directly under the table, and note
where it lives in the row's own cell.

| Round | Mutant | File | Anchor | Before | After | Verified Applied Via | Result | Expectation | Reason | Restored Verified | Replayed |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <!-- round --> | <!-- mutant --> | <!-- file --> | <!-- anchor --> | <!-- before --> | <!-- after --> | <!-- verified_applied_via --> | <!-- result --> | <!-- expectation --> | <!-- reason --> | <!-- restored_verified --> | <!-- replayed --> |

### Class Closure

One row per fix round (any round after the task's first) that fixed a review
finding: the defect class it closed, the search command run to enumerate other
sites of that class (blank when `Closure Kind` is not `enumerated`), the sites
the search found (blank when `Closure Kind` is not `enumerated`), and the
closure kind (`enumerated | source`) the implementer reported in
`class_closure`; `not_applicable` never appears in this table, since a row
exists only for a round that fixed a finding, never for the task's first round.
An unclosed site of the row's class is named in Risks / Notes with the reason.

| Round | Class | Enumeration Command | Sites | Closure Kind |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| <!-- round --> | <!-- class --> | <!-- enumeration_command --> | <!-- sites --> | <!-- closure_kind --> |

### Optional Probe Plan and Result Index

An optional runner-supported probe plan may be referenced here by relative
path, immutable revision/hash, and mutant locator/index. It helps later
assignments locate an unchanged definition but is never evidence by itself.
Each result reference binds that plan to checked state, cwd, attempt,
expectation, applied mutant, and restoration. Missing, stale, or unresolved
references block the relevant proof rather than count as skipped. Preserve the
legacy table above; when a source move requires a replacement plan, record its
intentional supersession and rationale in `03-decisions.md`.

| Plan reference | Immutable revision/hash | Mutant locator/index | Result reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| <!-- relative plan path --> | <!-- immutable id --> | <!-- locator --> | <!-- relative result artifact --> |

## Integration

<!-- Batch runs only (run mode `batch`); leave as is otherwise. Per merged
slice: branch or worktree, merge order, conflicts and how they were resolved,
and the verification set outcome on the integrated tree. -->
