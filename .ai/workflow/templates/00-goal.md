# Goal

<!-- solution-acceptance: run-base = TODO -->
<!-- solution-acceptance: run-base[<repo-basename>] = <sha> -->
<!-- solution-acceptance: mode = delegated -->
<!-- Run mode: single | delegated | batch. A missing or unrecognised value means delegated. -->
<!-- outward: classes = none -->
<!-- Outward action classes granted for this run without per-action
     operator confirmation: none, or a comma-separated subset of
     push-branch, open-pr (the only grantable classes). Default none.
     A new run starts at none whatever this template says; a class is
     added only on the operator's explicit instruction in the session,
     recorded in 03-decisions.md. See AGENTS.md's Outward-facing
     actions rule. -->

## Acceptance Baseline

For a newly created run that adopts this contract, record this declaration
before planning, slicing, or delegation:

Acceptance contract: acceptance-baseline/v1

For that recorded v1 selection, freeze the actual delegation input in this
canonical shape and communicate the selection in every delegation:

```yaml
acceptance_baseline:
  id: "" # e.g. acceptance-baseline
  revision: "" # e.g. r1
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: "" # e.g. AC-001
    required: true
    text: "" # frozen normative text
    verification: "" # exact command + expected outcome, or reviewer role + concrete artifact + pass/fail standard
    negative_space: "" # what this criterion does not establish
```

The orchestrator freezes these records before delegation. An implementer must
not change a criterion or its normative verification command. A baseline
revision records the old and new revisions, affected IDs, decision authority
and reason, invalidated evidence, and any verified rationale for carrying
unchanged evidence forward. Scope changes beyond the request need an operator
decision; invalidated evidence is rerun before acceptance.

This contract applies only to runs that explicitly record the declaration
above. Existing runs continue under their recorded original contract: missing
v1 fields neither identify a legacy run nor block it, and uncertain adoption
or provenance is reported and resolved before dependent delegation rather
than inferred. For a recorded original string-list contract, retain the
original `acceptance_criteria` strings and omit the introduced
`acceptance_baseline` and `criterion_evidence` fields. Keep the existing role
output fields; do not rewrite an old run to adopt this block.
